Homework 2 32-bit embedded linux
buttons_and_leds.py: blinks 4 LEDs based on 4 buttons, all things are tied to GPIOs with 
button 1 tied to LED 1 and so on. 

etchASketch_with_buttons2.py: basically the same etch a sketch program as homework 1. 
The only difference is that buttons 1-4 are used to direct the cursor with button1=right, 
button2=down, button3=left, and button4=up. Escape key still exits and space still shakes

to use either of the programs run with python not python3 and use the defined inputs.
