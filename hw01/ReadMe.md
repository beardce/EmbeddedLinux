Currently I have done the following:
1: Installed the latest BeagleBone Image
2: Set up my host computer with Ubuntu 16.04
3: Purchased or checked out the necessary cables and other items
4: Installed git on both my host and beaglebone
5: Signed up for the two beagle groups
6: Wrote a simple Etch-A-Sketch program

For the program in part 6 the user runs the program from the command line,
inputs the display height and width then the x and y coordinates for the 
initial position of the cursor. The arrow keys are then used to maneuver
the cursor and the space bar is used to "shake" the Etch-A-Sketch and clear
the screen. The escape key is used to exit the program.
